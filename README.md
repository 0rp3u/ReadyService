# ReadyService
This application is a test case for some of the most recent android architecture components and recommendations, applied to a realistic use case, it consist of a replacement for a restaurant/bar menu allowing a user to  not bother the waiter multiple times.
The functionallities mostly mocked since there is not API but all menus and organization is controlled by the API data.

* Choose a service type (in restaurant or take away);
* Visualize multiple menus and sub-menus;
* Visualize menu item details;
* Add/remove/update items to a list to order;
* Visualize all items ordered;
* Pay for all item ordered;
